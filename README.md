# This is week 2 challenge: COVID-19 Contact Tracing Program


## Instruction of this challenge

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic of today, everyone is doing their best to stop the spread of the virus by staying home.  Experts already stated that we need to wait until COVID-19 cases actually start to decline over several weeks before reopening businesses and going back to school and work. But once people start resuming their normal routines, it will be essential to trace contacts of a newly infected patient to contain emerging clusters of COVID-19 infections. Contact tracing is a key strategy for preventing further spread of the virus according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This weekâ€™s challenge is to write a Contact Tracing Program that produces a contact report of an infected patient.

At least one contacted person:
- a name,
